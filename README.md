# DosActividades
Learning to manage two activities on Android. 

#IN THIS BRANCH WE'D TRY TO IMPROVE THE CALCULATOR ACTIVITY

###Descrpition
In this app there is a first activity that allows the user to go to a second activty. In this second activity there is a numeric keyboard
that works as a sum calculator. 

###Main Activity
It just informs the user how to use the app. In the toolbar menu there is the option to share the result by mail. 
*How to improve*
This could be like tool box, adding more funcionalities.

###Calculadora Activity
Very simple, we just put the operation, then we push the button "=" and the result of the sum is made, sending us to the main activity.
The result will be shown in this activty, plus an extra info.
*How to improve*
Made a more complex calculator, able to do sum, substraction... etc. Now, the result is reached reading the text input that the
user has made, maybe this has to change. 

###TO SUMMER
This is just an app to practice, but it opens a lot of posibilities to practice more triyng to improve it.
